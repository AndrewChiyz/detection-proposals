Detection Proposals
===================

Evaluation of recall and repeatability of detection proposal algorithms

This code is not yet complete. Have a look at the [Project Page](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/object-recognition-and-scene-understanding/how-good-are-detection-proposals-really/) for more information. Please contact me if you want to use the code or want to benchmark your detection proposal method!


Plot evaluation curves
----------------------

1. Get the data that you want to use from the [Project Page](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/object-recognition-and-scene-understanding/how-good-are-detection-proposals-really/).
2. Edit get_config.m to point to the right locations for images, candidates and so on.
3. Run plot_recall_voc07.m, curves will be in the figures subdirectory.
