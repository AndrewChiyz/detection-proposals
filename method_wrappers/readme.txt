This are the wrapper scripts for each proposal method that I used. The point
of this code is to provide reproducability of the results and document which
parameters were used for each of the methods.

This code may also ease using those methods, but I also had to modify the code
of some of those methods to be able to run multiple instances at the same time
in a cluster. You have been warned. :)
